# 🏛️ Snippo AI UI/UX Implementation Guidelines

These standards must be followed across all components, pages, and features in the Snippo AI codebase — including all AI-generated or team-built sections.

---

## ⚙️ Component & Structure Standards

- Use **ShadCN UI components** strictly from the path: `@/components/ui`
- Follow **Next.js App Router** architecture only (no use of the legacy `pages/` directory)
- Components must be **responsive by default** using utility-first layout practices
- Use **semantic HTML** wherever appropriate (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`)
- Do not use **a** tags for links, use **Link** component from next js

---

## 🌑 Theming & Styling

- All styling must be compatible with the **dark theme** and respect Tailwind's dark mode classes
- Use **fluid typography classes** from `globals.css`, such as:
  - `text-fluid-sm`
  - `text-fluid-base`
  - `text-fluid-lg`
- Do **not** use hardcoded spacing, font sizes, or colors
  - Always prefer **Tailwind utilities** or **theme tokens** from the design system
- It should look and feel like an AI website

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

- Use **theme-consistent gradients and shadows** for backgrounds, cards, and headings
- All **buttons and CTA elements** must follow the design system’s:
  - `primary`
  - `secondary`
  - `ghost` variants
- Avoid deviating from existing style tokens unless explicitly scoped

---

## 🌀 Animations

- Animations must be:
  - **Subtle**, **accessible**, and **non-blocking**
  - Applied using classes defined in `globals.css`
  - Never defined inline in JSX or inline styles
- Use standard animation class naming like:
  - `.fade-in`
  - `.slide-up`
  - `.pulse-on-hover`

---

## ✅ Performance & Accessibility

- All components must be:
  - **Lighthouse-optimized** (Core Web Vitals friendly)
  - **Minimal in DOM size and dependencies**
  - **Lazy-loaded** when appropriate
- Ensure **accessibility** by:
  - Using proper `aria-*` labels
  - Supporting keyboard navigation
  - Including visible focus indicators (`focus-visible`)
  - Using semantic roles (e.g., `role="dialog"`, `role="button"`)
- Ensure best SEO practices for pages
